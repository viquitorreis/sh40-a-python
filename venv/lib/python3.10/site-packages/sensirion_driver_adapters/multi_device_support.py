    Decorator to define a driver for multiple sensors.

    The intended usage is:
    ```
    @multi_driver(driver_class)
    class my_multi_driver:
        ...
    ```
    The class my_multi_driver will be a new class that can be initialized with an instance of AbstractMultiChannel. It
    contains all methods of driver class. But each of these methods returns a tuple of responses one result for each
    channel in the AbstractMultiChannel.
    The wrapped class my_multi_driver may contain methods by its own. These methods will not be wrapped but executed
    like normal python methods.
    In case a __init__ method is needed, it has to contain a ** argument and the constructor of the wrapped type has to
    be called with named arguments including the channel argument of the driver_class constructor.

    :param driver_class: driver class to be wrapped in the new multi-driver class.
    :param execute_concurrent: Two modes of operation are possible. Whe executing a driver function, each driver is
    called sequentially when execute_concurrent is set to False.
    When execute_concurrent is set to True, a worker thread is
    spawned for each channel and the function is invoked on each thread individually. This method is appropriate when
    the commands to be executed may contain a long wait time before reading the response.

    :return: a new type that provides the above described functionalities.
